**TranCIT - Student Transit Guide** is a mobile-responsive web application designed to revolutionize the commuting experience for students in Cebu City. It specifically targets freshmen, transferees, and non-local students who are often unfamiliar with the local Public Utility Jeepney (PUJ) system. Our mission is to transform a typically complex and anxiety-inducing daily task into a straightforward, efficient, and stress-free journey.

## üéØ Problem Solved

Navigating Cebu's jeepney system presents significant challenges due to:
- **Alphanumeric route codes** (e.g., 13C, 04L)
- **Reliance on informal landmark-based directions**
- **Scarcity of comprehensive, accurate digital mapping tools**

This results in:
- Students getting lost
- Taking inefficient routes
- Overpaying for fares
- Experiencing undue stress and safety concerns
